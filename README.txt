Compulsory Task 2

In this task, you are going to be creating a personal webpage. Make sure that this
webpage acts as a resume and introduces you to the world effectively. Strike a
balance in your content — this webpage should show more of your personality
than a typical CV but it should still be professional.

Follow these steps:
  ● Create an HTML page called index.html.
  ● On this page add any elements you would like to create a webpage that
    acts as an online CV. This is your personal webpage, so feel free to customise
    it to suit your needs but make sure that you include at least the following:
    ○ A short bio. Add a short (no more than about three paragraphs)
      description of yourself. Who are you? What is your experience? What
      are your passions? What motivates you? What is it that you would
      most like to do? Etc.
    ○ Your contact details. E.g. name, contact number, email address, links
      to any of your (professional) social media including LinkedIn. An
      image of yourself.
    ○ A list of your skills and competencies.
    ○ Describe your education.
    ○ Describe your work experience.
    ○ As you progress through this course you can keep adding to this
      personal webpage. For example, in the near future, you can describe
      some projects that you have worked on and add links to the code (in
      GitHub).
    ○ Add links to any blog posts or articles that you have written.
  ● Use CSS to style and position the elements on your webpage as attractively
  as possible. Feel free to use style libraries like Bootstrap.
  ● Create a new repository for this task called MyCV.
  ● Following the steps in Compulsory Task 1, deploy your webpage using
    GitHub Pages.
  ● Add the index.html file from this task into this task’s folder as well as a
  screenshot of your deployed webpage.
